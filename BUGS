- pseudo-instructions are largely unimplemented
- symbol table dump at end of assembly is not sorted
- line numbers in listing and/or symbol table dump don't correspond to actual source lines
- improve source code commentary
- check all constants and predefined tables for correctness
- expression operators are a bit skimpy (only add, subtract, negate)
- MOSTLY FIXED no native DG Nova object file output
